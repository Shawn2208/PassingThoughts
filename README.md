# PassingThoughts
Basically you can share your thoughts them being intrusive this is more of a mental health project just for you to get your thoughts out and hopefully make that that person 
feel a little bit better,
mental health is on the rise ever since covid 19 and mostly men dont talk to someone so i decided to make this app for people like me and men out there that dont want to 
talk to anyone. you will feel so much better for it and it might even warm you up to go see a professional.
also i have put a feature in this app if you mention suicide it will prompt you with 3 Links to seek help.
